# What's happening?

Microsoft is acquiring GitHub. That's right, all of our code will soon be hosted on a Microsoft platform.

I don't want to be a part of this. [I have already moved all of my code to GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gabmus) and I will not update any of my github repos anymore.

If you have opened an issue or PR on one of my repos, it's still there, and it will be for a while, but please keep the conversations going on GitLab instead.

Microsoft is an enemy of Open Source and Free Software, and I will do my part in moving away from it in any way I can.
